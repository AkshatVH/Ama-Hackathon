## UpTrain -- Examples to get started quickly

In this section, we consider the following 3 tasks:

1. *Orientation classification*: In this example, we consider a binary classification task of human orientation while exercising. That is, given the location of 17 key-points of the body such as the nose, shoulders, wrist, hips, ankles, etc., the model tries to predict whether the person is in a horizontal or a vertical position. In this task, we have created several jupyter notebook files that somewhat exhaustively demonstrate the features of the UpTrain package. **It's recommended to use this task to get started with UpTrain**.

2. *Cyber-attack classification*: In this example, we monitor the performance of the machine learning model by measuring the [concept drift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_drift) using the UpTrain package in the [NSL-KDD dataset](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html). Specifically, we use two monitors to measure the drift, one is the popular [Drift Detection Method](https://riverml.xyz/dev/api/drift/DDM/) and other is customly defined. 

3. *Shopping cart recommendation*: In this example, we consider the task of recommending items for purchase to a user. Here, we measure the [popularity bias](https://computersciencewiki.org/index.php/Popularity_bias) in the recommended items. Also, we measure two custom defined metrics: 1) cosine distance between the embeddings of predicted and bought (that is, ground truth) items, 2) Absolute log price ratio between predicted and bought items.
